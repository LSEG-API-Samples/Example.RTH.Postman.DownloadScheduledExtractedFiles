# Postman Collection: Downloading completed extraction files by a schedule name 

DataScope Select is a hosted delivery platform for non-streaming cross-asset data. It is also the same platform that supports Refintiv Tick History. Users can extract data from DSS or RTH via the DSS Web GUI or REST API. 

Data can be extracted through either of two basic mechanisms. The first one is Scheduled Extractions, which occur at a pre-defined moment in time which could be once-of, or recurring. Scheduled extractions can be created using the website, or REST API. The second type of extraction mechanism is OnDemand extractions, which occur immediately when requested. On-Demand extractions can only be created using the REST API. The choice of mechanisms depends on the workflow you want to create.

Typically, users can use the DSS web GUI to download extraction files created by scheduled extractions via the DSS web GUI. This postman collection shows the steps to use the DSS REST API to download extraction files created by scheduled extractions.
